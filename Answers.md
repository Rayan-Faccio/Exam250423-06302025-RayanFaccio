## Question 1:

### Part A:

**Questions I would ask based on the given prompt:**

"Are any of those browser tabs important or pertinent to the task you wish to execute on excel?"
I would ask this so I can know if they can simply just close all the tabs to free up a lot of memory so they can use excel properly. Simply closing the browser tabs will likely lead to the desired result of being able to use excel. A minimum of asking them to close any tabs they definetly do not need for the task they want.

"Are there any plugins or extensions you have installed on your chrome?"
This is to confirm if there are any plugins that may be consuming more memory. Having 1 to 3 plugins tends to be fine and relatively unseen depending what they are, but having dozens of them that are constantly running could lead to performance issues.

"Have you tried using the memory saver function on chrome"
Using a built in memory saver could be a simple solution that works relatively effectively. Certain browsers such as the one I use at home (Opera GX) you can set a custom limit on how much RAM you want it to be able to use
I personally have enough memory and tend to keep apps closed when not in use so I do not require the use of this function anymore, however on my old computer I did use this feature and I did see a noticable difference.

**Research Discovery**
Due to my experience with computers and in the IT field I already knew most of the basic questions to ask on how to troubleshoot someones memory consumption, however these sites were helpful as it described and often overlooked feature that being the memory saver function that is built into most modern browsers as well as considering plugins could be a cause of the extra memory usage. They do mention clearing cache and cookies which is another great way to potentially free up RAM, however once they start browsing again and if they always use the same sites, it will most likely only be effective temproarily until the sites they visited before have all been revisited.
