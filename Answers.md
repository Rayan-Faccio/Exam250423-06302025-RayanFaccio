## Question 1:

### Part A:

**Questions I would ask based on the given prompt:** \
https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/chrome-high-ram-usage/ \
https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/321227995/google-chrome-is-using-a-lot-memory-ram?hl=en

"Are any of those browser tabs important or pertinent to the task you wish to execute on excel?"
I would ask this so I can know if they can simply just close all the tabs to free up a lot of memory so they can use excel properly. Simply closing the browser tabs will likely lead to the desired result of being able to use excel. A minimum of asking them to close any tabs they definetly do not need for the task they want.

"Are there any plugins or extensions you have installed on your chrome?"
This is to confirm if there are any plugins that may be consuming more memory. Having 1 to 3 plugins tends to be fine and relatively unseen depending what they are, but having dozens of them that are constantly running could lead to performance issues.

"Have you tried using the memory saver function on chrome"
Using a built in memory saver could be a simple solution that works relatively effectively. Certain browsers such as the one I use at home (Opera GX) you can set a custom limit on how much RAM you want it to be able to use
I personally have enough memory and tend to keep apps closed when not in use so I do not require the use of this function anymore, however on my old computer I did use this feature and I did see a noticable difference.

**Research Discovery**
Due to my experience with computers and in the IT field I already knew most of the basic questions to ask on how to troubleshoot someones memory consumption, however these sites were helpful as it described and often overlooked feature that being the memory saver function that is built into most modern browsers as well as considering plugins could be a cause of the extra memory usage. They do mention clearing cache and cookies which is another great way to potentially free up RAM, however once they start browsing again and if they always use the same sites, it will most likely only be effective temproarily until the sites they visited before have all been revisited.

This link showed some genral and useful steps to troubleshooting RAM consumption.This site seemed particularly useful as it offered 10 solutions ranging from easy and simple to slightly more complex and one outright just saying to upgrade your RAM. I think that upgrading RAM is heavily underrated of a reccomendation as RAM is one of the easier parts to add to a computer and most of the time RAM is extremely affordable for a high quantity and decent quality speeds, especially for simple everyday tasks such as using office software and browsing the web. Although I like saying adding more RAM is a good idea, sometimes it isn't necessary when a simple fix can solve the issue and not cost you any money. Staying vigilant on what and how many programs or tabs of a browser you open as the website suggests and limitting startup apps as well which I do on my personal computer so I only open what I absolutely need when booting my computer.

This link gave less examples, but the simple and effective ones, but for the 2 main operating systems Windows and Mac. The solutions are easy to do and explained for both OS's which is why I like this site as it can be used by almost anyone having issues. Linux users tend to already be more tech literate and have a deeper understanding and since all linux distributions are different there isn't really a way for the site to show solutions for any or all Linux distros. One solution this site reccomends that I don't see often is to clear temporary files which as they state are temporary, however in practice they dont seem to be that way sometimes. Clearing them can not only help memoery but also clear up a little bit of storage on your drive.

This link gives examples from a security company, so as you can imagine scanning for malware is a relatively good reccomendation that you could do even for the people who think they are safe on the internet. I also think scanning for malware is an underrated way of checking memory overconsumption as they can be discretly mining crypto on your GPU which will not only potentially impact performance, but will also lower the lifespan of your computer parts. Another interesting solution this site suggested in particular is to "exchange visuals for performance" as they said. Which is to limit any animations and such that may have visual clutter. Going into your pc and adjusting for performance is a good way to optimize your desktop.

This is a really well detailed page about steps you can take to troubleshoot apps and most of these are what you should always think to do such as looking for the documentation of the app, microsoft has their apps well documented and can be easily found through google search. A decent amount of apps even have a built in help feature so you can learn either commands or steps to take to get your desired result whether its something to do in the app like insertion into excel or if its how to change a setting in the app to optimize performance the built in help can offer many solutions to common problems.

This link is helpful for people of all sorts of level in the IT field. Whether its a basic client side issue or an issue regarding database management or even server side architecture this site has brief descriptions on what some tips for troubleshooting applications in these many fields may be like. Although this isn't similar to the numbered lists with outright solutions to common issues this can often be more helpful by leading you into the right direction on what specifically to search for or what to take as a next step for troubleshooting. Not all issues will be clear with a google search or with some digging into documentation. Sometimes getting help on forums or even contacting support for the company with what you might be having an issue with can be the best solution depending on your situation.
